        </h1> 
   <p>
    Welcome to Swayambhu Laxmi - your go-to destination for the best homemade masalas! We are a spice shop that was formed during Dusshera in the 2020s with the aim of providing authentic taste of homemade masalas to working people. Our masalas are made using traditional tools such as the dankh, which preserves the masala oil and brings out the rich aroma and taste.
    Our founder was inspired to start this business when she realized that many working people had no access to homemade masalas due to their busy schedules. She recognized the importance of fresh, healthy ingredients and wanted to provide a solution for those who wanted to enjoy authentic taste without having to spend hours in the kitchen.
